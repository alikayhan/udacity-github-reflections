When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want to make my repository public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might be trying something experimentally on remote repository and we might do not want it to be synced with our local repository. Manual pulling gives us the complete control over repositories.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want to make my repository public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might be trying something experimentally on remote repository and we might do not want it to be synced with our local repository. Manual pulling gives us the complete control over repositories.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forking is used when we want to make changes to other people's code but we also want to keep the original unchanged. Cloning is getting the repository from a remote and working on it on other place. Branches are made when we want to add new features, new modes, fix the bugs etc. but we do not want to break the code in the master branch.
